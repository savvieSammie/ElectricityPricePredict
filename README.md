# ElectricityPricePredict
Predicting the price of electricity consumed depends on some factors, for example you might own a business that uses a lot of gadgets to keep the business going. Now the number of times the devices are used will vary as they will depend on business need. That said, how much you use spend on electricity will be affected by a many of factors but it is important to determine a way to be able to predict the price of electricity in order to include this in cost planning. This project can also help homes and private electricity consumers in determining how much they spend on electricity and also determine ways to reduce electricity bills.

In this project I built a model that can help predict the price of electricity used by a businesss, I used a Random Forest regression model since the problem is a regression type.

Model has a MAE value of  9.401643359426828 and 
R2_score of 0.5419293451879772
